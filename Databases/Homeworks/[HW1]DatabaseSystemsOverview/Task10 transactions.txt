Transactions are sequence of database operations which are executed as single unit.
If one of the operations failed all transaction fails and doesn't change database.
If all the operations succeed transaction is executed and make changes in database. 

Transactions guarantee the consistency and the integrity of the database.
	All changes in a transaction are temporary.
	Changes become final when COMMIT is successfully executed.
	At any time all changes done in the transaction can be canceled by executing ROLLBACK.
All operations are executed as a single unit.
	Either all of them pass or none of them.
