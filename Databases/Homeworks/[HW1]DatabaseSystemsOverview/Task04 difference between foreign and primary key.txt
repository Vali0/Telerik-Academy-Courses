Primary key is unique integer number. In most cases this is the left most column in database table.
It indicates each data entity. Two entities are different if and only if their primary keys are different.
The primary key can be composed by several entities(composite primary key)

Foreign key is using to make relations between two or more tables in database. It is an identifier of a record located in another table
usually its the primary key of the other table. By using relationships we avoid repeating data in the database.
