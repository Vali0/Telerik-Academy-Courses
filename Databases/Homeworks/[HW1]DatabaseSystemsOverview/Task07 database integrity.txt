Data integrity refers to the overall completeness, accuracy and consistency of data. 
This can be indicated by the absence of alteration between two instances or between two updates of a data record, meaning data is intact and unchanged. 
Data integrity is usually imposed during the database design phase through the use of standard procedures and rules. 
Data integrity can be maintained through the use of various error checking methods and validation procedures.
