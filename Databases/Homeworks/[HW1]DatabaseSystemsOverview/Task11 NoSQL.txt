A NoSQL or Not Only SQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is 
modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. 
Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. 
The data structure (e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differs from the RDBMS, and therefore some operations are faster in NoSQL and some in RDBMS. 
There are differences though, and the particular suitability of a given NoSQL DB depends on the problem it must solve 
(e.g., does the solution use graph algorithms?).
NoSQL still support all CRUD operations, indexing, querying, concurrency and transactions.
They are highly optimized for append or retrieve, great performance and scalability.
