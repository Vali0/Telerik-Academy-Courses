Indexes speed up searching of values in a certain column or group of columns.
Usually implemented as B-trees.
Indexes can be built-in the table (clustered) or stored externally (non-clustered).
Adding and deleting records in indexed tables is slower!
Indexes should be used for big tables only (e.g. 50 000 rows).
