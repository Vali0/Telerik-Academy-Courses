What is the expected running time of the following C# code? Explain why. Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.
long CalcCount(int[,] matrix)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int row=0; row<matrix.GetLength(0); row++)
        if (matrix[row, 0] % 2 == 0)
            for (int col=0; col<matrix.GetLength(1); col++)
                if (matrix[row,col] > 0)
                    count++;
    return count;
}

The complexity of algorithm is O(n - z + z * m) where z is the number of the even numbers in the first column of matrix.
Outside loop has n iterations in inside loop algorithm goes only if the number in each cell of first column is even number
If numbers in first column are odd the complexity will be O(n) and if they're all even complexity will be O(n*m)
