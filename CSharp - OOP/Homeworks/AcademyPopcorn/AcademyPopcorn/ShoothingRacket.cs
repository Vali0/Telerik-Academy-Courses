    //Task 13: Implement a shoot ability for the player racket. The ability should only be activated when a 
    //Gift object falls on the racket. The shot objects should be a new class (e.g. Bullet) 
    //and should destroy normal Block objects (and be destroyed on collision with any block). 
    //Use the engine and ShootPlayerRacket method you implemented in task 4, but don't add items in any of the engine 
    //lists through the ShootPlayerRacket method. Also don't edit the Racket.cs file. Hint: you should have a 
    //ShootingRacket class and override its ProduceObjects method.
